# yt-chapters

This tool was created as a proof-of-concept for adding "Chapter" information to descriptions of YouTube videos, for Dr. Nitin Paranjape. For details, see his [blog post](https://efficiency365.com/2020/06/05/youtube-chapter-creation-tool).

Briefly, YouTube can parse chapter headings and timestamps in the description of a video, and overlay these headings on the video's timeline. The headings have to be in chronological order, with the first heading bearing a zero timestamp, 0:00 or 0:0:00.

This tool allows the creation of such chapter headings in the correct format, and can update the description of a YouTube video.
